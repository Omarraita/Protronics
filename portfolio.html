                    <h3>ECG Monitoring Patch</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developed a cutting-edge wearable ECG monitoring patch for continuous cardiac health assessment. The patch integrates 
                        a highly sensitive analog front-end circuit for precise signal acquisition, low-power wireless communication for data 
                        transmission, and advanced signal processing algorithms for real-time analysis. The project involved extensive hardware 
                        testing and optimization to meet stringent medical-grade certification standards, ensuring reliability, accuracy, and 
                        comfort for long-term use by patients.

                    <h3>Custom Wearable PCB Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Engineered a compact and efficient PCB design for wearable devices, focusing on power efficiency, miniaturization, and 
                        robust performance. The project addressed the challenges of integrating multiple sensors, battery management systems, 
                        and communication modules into a small form factor. The PCB was rigorously tested under various environmental conditions 
                        to ensure durability and functionality in real-world scenarios. This design is now deployed in wearable fitness trackers 
                        and health monitoring devices, setting a new standard for innovation in the wearable electronics space.
